This is the completion of assignment 1 from ITP's Printing Code course, taught by Rune Madsen.

The assignment was as follows:
[Create a Processing sketch.] A few rules about your code: You can only use black (0) and white (255). 
You are only allowed to use triangle(), rect() and ellipse() once each, and no other drawing functions are 
allowed (no beginShape or images). ...Design an ice cream cone. Yes, an ice cream cone.
